# 01 Matrix

Given an `m x n` binary matrix `mat`, return _the distance of the nearest_`0` _for each cell_.

The distance between two cells sharing a common edge is `1`.

 

**Example 1:**

    **Input:** mat = [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0]]
    **Output:** [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0]]
    

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/04/24/01-2-grid.jpg)
    
    
    **Input:** mat = [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[1,1,1]]
    **Output:** [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[1,2,1]]
    

 

**Constraints:**

  * `m == mat.length`
  * `n == mat[i].length`
  * `1 <= m, n <= 104`
  * `1 <= m * n <= 104`
  * `mat[i][j]` is either `0` or `1`.
  * There is at least one `0` in `mat`.
