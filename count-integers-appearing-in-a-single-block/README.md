# Count Integers Appearing in a Single Block

You are given an integer array `nums`.

An integer `x` is **special** if all occurrences of `x` in `nums` appear in a single **contiguous** block.

Return the number of **distinct** special integers in `nums`.

 

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [1,2,2,1]

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:**

  * 1 appears at indices 0 and 3, forming two separate blocks, so it is not special.
  * 2 appears in a single contiguous block at indices `[1, 2]`, so it is special.



Therefore, there is one special integer.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [3,3,1,2,2,1]

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:**

  * 3 appears in a single contiguous block at indices `[0, 1]`, so it is special.
  * 1 appears at indices 2 and 5, forming two separate blocks, so it is not special.
  * 2 appears in a single contiguous block at indices `[3, 4]`, so it is special.



Therefore, there are two special integers.

 

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
  * `1 <= nums[i] <= 100`
