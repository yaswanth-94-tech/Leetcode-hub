# Check ASCII Palindromic

You are given a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters.

Construct a **binary string** by replacing each character in `s` with the 8-bit binary representation of its ASCII value, **including leading zeros** , while preserving the original order of the characters.

Return `true` if the resulting binary string is a **palindrome**. Otherwise, return `false`.

 

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "ff"

**Output:** true

**Explanation:**

  * The ASCII value of `f` is 102, whose 8-bit binary representation is `01100110`.
  * Thus, the binary string is `0110011001100110`.
  * Since this binary string is a **palindrome** , the output is `true`.



**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "leet"

**Output:** false

**Explanation:**

  * The ASCII values of `l`, `e`, `e`, and `t` are 108, 101, 101, and 116, respectively.
  * Their 8-bit binary representations are `01101100`, `01100101`, `01100101`, and `01110100`.
  * Thus, the binary string is `01101100011001010110010101110100`.
  * Since this binary string is not a **palindrome** , the output is `false`.



 

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= s.length <= 100`
  * `s` consists of lowercase English letters.
