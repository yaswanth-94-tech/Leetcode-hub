# Count K-th Roots in a Range

You are given three integers `l`, `r`, and `k`.

An integer `y` is said to be a **perfect k th power** if there exists an integer `x` such that `y = xk`.

Return the number of integers `y` in the range `[l, r]` (inclusive) that are **perfect k th powers**.

 

**Example 1:**

**Input:** l = 1, r = 9, k = 3

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:**

The perfect cubes in the range `[1, 9]` are: 

  * `1 = 13`
  * `8 = 23`

Hence, the answer is 2.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** l = 8, r = 30, k = 2

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:**

The perfect squares in the range `[8, 30]` are: 

  * `9 = 32`
  * `16 = 42`
  * `25 = 52`

Hence, the answer is 3.

 

**Constraints:**

  * `0 <= l <= r <= 109`
  * `1 <= k <= 30`
