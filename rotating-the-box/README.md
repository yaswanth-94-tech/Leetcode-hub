# Rotating the Box

You are given an `m x n` matrix of characters `boxGrid` representing a side-view of a box. Each cell of the box is one of the following:

  * A stone `'#'`
  * A stationary obstacle `'*'`
  * Empty `'.'`



The box is rotated **90 degrees clockwise** , causing some of the stones to fall due to gravity. Each stone falls down until it lands on an obstacle, another stone, or the bottom of the box. Gravity **does not** affect the obstacles' positions, and the inertia from the box's rotation **does not** affect the stones' horizontal positions.

It is **guaranteed** that each stone in `boxGrid` rests on an obstacle, another stone, or the bottom of the box.

Return _an_`n x m` _matrix representing the box after the rotation described above_.

 

**Example 1:**

    **Input:** boxGrid = [["#",".","#"]]
    **Output:** [["."],
             ["#"],
             ["#"]]
    

**Example 2:**

    **Input:** boxGrid = [["#",".","*","."],
                  ["#","#","*","."]]
    **Output:** [["#","."],
             ["#","#"],
             ["*","*"],
             [".","."]]
    

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/04/08/rotatingtheboxleetcode3withstone.png)
    
    
    **Input:** boxGrid = [["#","#","*",".","*","."],
                  ["#","#","#","*",".","."],
                  ["#","#","#",".","#","."]]
    **Output:** [[".","#","#"],
             [".","#","#"],
             ["#","#","*"],
             ["#","*","."],
             ["#",".","*"],
             ["#",".","."]]
    

 

**Constraints:**

  * `m == boxGrid.length`
  * `n == boxGrid[i].length`
  * `1 <= m, n <= 500`
  * `boxGrid[i][j]` is either `'#'`, `'*'`, or `'.'`.
