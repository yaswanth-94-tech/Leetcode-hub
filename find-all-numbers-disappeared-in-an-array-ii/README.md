# Find All Numbers Disappeared in an Array II

You are given an integer array `nums` and two integers `lower` and `upper`.

A **missing integer** is an integer in the inclusive range `[lower, upper]` that does not appear in `nums`.

Return a 2D integer array where each element is of the form `[start, end]`, representing a **contiguous** range of missing integers. Return the ranges in **increasing** order. If there are no missing integers, return an empty array.

**Note:** Consecutive missing integers should be grouped into a single range.

 

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [3,9,7], lower = 1, upper = 12

**Output:** [[1,2],[4,6],[8,8],[10,12]]

**Explanation:**

  * The missing integers are `[1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12]`.
  * Grouping the missing integers into the minimum number of contiguous ranges, we get `[1, 2]`, `[4, 6]`, `[8, 8]`, and `[10, 12]`.
  * Therefore, the answer is `[[1, 2], [4, 6], [8, 8], [10, 12]]`.



**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [1,1], lower = 5, upper = 7

**Output:** [[5,7]]

**Explanation:**

  * The missing integers are `[5, 6, 7]`.
  * Grouping the missing integers into the minimum number of contiguous ranges, we get `[5, 7]`.
  * Therefore, the answer is `[[5, 7]]`.



**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = [2,3,5], lower = 2, upper = 3

**Output:** []

**Explanation:**

  * There are no missing integers.
  * Therefore, the answer is `[]`.



 

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
  * `1 <= nums[i] <= 105`
  * `1 <= lower <= upper <= 105`
