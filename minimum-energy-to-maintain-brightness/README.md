# Minimum Energy to Maintain Brightness

You are given an integer `n`, representing `n` light bulbs arranged in a line and indexed from 0 to `n - 1`.

You are also given an integer `brightness` and a 2D integer array `intervals`, where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]` represents an **inclusive** time interval during which the lighting requirement **must** be satisfied.

At each time unit, every bulb can independently be either on or off. A bulb that is on **illuminates** its own position and its **adjacent** positions, if they exist.

The **total illumination** at a time unit is the number of **illuminated** positions. Each position is counted **at most once**.

For every integer time unit covered by **at least** one interval in `intervals`, the **total illumination** must be **at least** `brightness`. At time units not covered by any interval, all bulbs may remain off. Each bulb that is on consumes 1 unit of energy for that time unit.

Return an integer denoting the **minimum** total energy required.

 

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 5, brightness = 5, intervals = [[6,12]]

**Output:** 14

**Explanation:**

  * Turn on the light bulbs at positions 1 and 4.
  * Current state of line: `0 1 0 0 1`.
  * All 5 positions are illuminated, so the required brightness is reached.
  * The active interval has length `12 - 6 + 1 = 7`, so the total energy is `2 * 7 = 14`.



**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 2, brightness = 1, intervals = [[0,0],[2,2]]

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:**

  * Turn on one light bulb during each active interval.
  * Each interval has length 1, so the total active time is `1 + 1 = 2`.
  * The total energy is `1 * 2 = 2`.



**Example 3:**

**Input:** n = 4, brightness = 2, intervals = [[1,3],[2,4]]

**Output:** 4

**Explanation:**

  * Turn on one light bulb. It can illuminate at least 2 positions.
  * The active intervals overlap, so the total active time is the length of `[1,4]`, which is 4.
  * The total energy is `1 * 4 = 4`.



 

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= n <= 106`
  * `1 <= brightness <= n`
  * `1 <= intervals.length <= 105`
  * `intervals[i] == [starti, endi]`
  * `0 <= starti <= endi <= 109`
