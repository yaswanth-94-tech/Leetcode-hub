# Count Values With Equally Spaced Occurrences I

You are given an integer array `nums`.

An integer `x` is called **special** if:

  * `x` appears **exactly three** times in `nums`.
  * **All** three occurrences of `x` are **equally spaced** in `nums`. In other words, if all occurrences of `x` are at indices `i1 < i2 < i3`, then `i2 - i1 = i3 - i2`.



Return the number of **distinct** special integers in `nums`.

 

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [1,8,1,5,1,5,8,5]

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:**

  * 1 is special because it occurs exactly three times at equally spaced indices 0, 2, and 4.
  * 5 is special because it occurs exactly three times at equally spaced indices 3, 5, and 7.
  * 8 is not special because it occurs only twice.



Therefore, the answer is 2.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [8,8,8,8]

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:**

8 is not special because it does not occur exactly three times. Therefore, the answer is 0.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = [8,6,6,8,8]

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:**

8 occurs at indices 0, 3, and 4, which are not equally spaced. 6 occurs only twice. Therefore, no integer is special.

 

**Constraints:**

  * `3 <= nums.length <= 100`
  * `1 <= nums[i] <= 100`
