# Minimum Days to Score Exactly N Points

You are given an integer `n` representing a target score.

Your score starts at 0, and each day you either **earn** points or **skip**.

Points are earned during a streak. On the first day of a streak you earn 1 point, on the second day 2 points, on the third day 3 points, and so on. **Skipping** a day earns **nothing** and **resets** the streak, so the next time you earn points, you start from 1 again.

Return the **minimum** number of days, including any skipped days, needed to reach a score of **exactly** `n`.

 

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 2

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:** ​​​​​​​

  * Day 1: earn 1 point. Score is 1.
  * Day 2: skip, which resets the streak. Earning here would add 2 points and take the score past `n = 2`.
  * Day 3: the streak has reset, so earning gives 1 point. Score is exactly `n = 2` in 3 days.



**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 9

**Output:** 6

**Explanation:** ​​​​​​​

  * Days 1 to 3: earn 1, 2, and 3 points. Score is `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`.
  * Day 4: skip, which resets the streak.
  * Days 5 and 6: earn 1 and 2 points. Score is exactly `6 + 1 + 2 = 9` in 6 days.



**Example 3:**

**Input:** n = 12

**Output:** 7

**Explanation:** ​​​​​​​

  * Days 1 to 3: earn 1, 2, and 3 points. Score is `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`.
  * Day 4: skip, which resets the streak.
  * Days 5 to 7: earn 1, 2, and 3 points. Score is exactly `6 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 12` in 7 days.



 

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= n <= 105`
