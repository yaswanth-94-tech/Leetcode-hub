# Frequency Balance Subarray

You are given an integer array ​​​​​​​`nums`.

Define a **frequency balance subarray** as follows:

  * If the subarray contains only one distinct value, it is frequency balanced.
  * Otherwise, there must exist a positive integer `f` such that every distinct value in the subarray occurs either `f` or `2 * f` times, and both frequencies occur among the distinct values.



Return an integer denoting the length of the **longest** frequency balance subarray.

 

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [1,2,2,1,2,3,3,3]

**Output:** 5

**Explanation:**

  * The longest frequency balance subarray is `[2, 1, 2, 3, 3]`.
  * The elements that appear most frequently are 2 and 3, both appearing twice.
  * The remaining element 1 appears once, meeting the requirements.



**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [5,5,5,5]

**Output:** 4

**Explanation:**

  * The longest frequency balance subarray is `[5, 5, 5, 5]`.
  * The element that appears most frequently is 5.
  * There are no other elements meeting the requirements.



**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = [1,2,3,4]

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:**

Since all elements appear only once, the length of the longest frequency balance subarray is 1.

 

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= nums.length <= 10​​​​​​​3`
  * `1 <= nums[i] <= 10​​​​​​​9`
