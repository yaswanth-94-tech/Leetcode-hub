# Maximum Pulse Value After One Subarray Rotation

You are given an integer array `nums` of length `n`.

Define the **pulse value** of an integer array `arr` as the **alternating sum** starting at index 0: `pulse(arr) = arr[0] - arr[1] + arr[2] - arr[3] + ...`.

You may perform **at most** one operation on `nums`:

  * Choose two indices `l` and `r` such that `0 <= l < r < n`.
  * **Left-rotate** the subarray `nums[l..r]` by **exactly** one position. For example, `[a, b, c, d]` becomes `[b, c, d, a]`.



Return the **maximum pulse value** that can be obtained after performing **at most** one such operation.

 

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [1,5,2]

**Output:** 6

**Explanation:**

  * The original pulse value is `1 - 5 + 2 = -2`.
  * Rotate the subarray `nums[0..1]` from `[1, 5]` to `[5, 1]`.
  * The resulting array is `[5, 1, 2]` and its pulse value is `5 - 1 + 2 = 6`, which is the maximum possible.



**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [6,4,3]

**Output:** 7

**Explanation:**

  * The original pulse value is `6 - 4 + 3 = 5`.
  * Rotate the subarray `nums[1..2]` from `[4, 3]` to `[3, 4]`.
  * The resulting array is `[6, 3, 4]` and its pulse value is `6 - 3 + 4 = 7`, which is the maximum possible.



**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = [9,7]

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:**

The original pulse value is `9 - 7 = 2`, which is already maximum. Thus, no rotation is required.

 

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= n == nums.length <= 105`
  * `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`
